Improvements:

1. Unit tests on Business Logic methods.
2. UI side data validation.
3. Implement strongly typed Result class as returned object from Business Logic methods, in this way, messages from the other layers could get to the UI side if needed.
4. Extend the Employee and/or EmployeeType tables to store different salary rates, allowances and deductions.
